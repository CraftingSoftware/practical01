# Practical 01: Using Git on Your Own

## Introduction

In this practical assignment, you will fix and extend a sorting program, `sort.py`. By the end of this exercise, you should have the tools and knowledge to be able to demonstrate mastery of the following essential technical skills of software engineering:

- How to create small, focused commits
- How to write good commit messages

Please read [Using Git on Your Own](https://buildtogether.tech/git-solo/). 

## Instructions

### Installing Tools

For this course, you must use an integrated development environment (IDE), such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/), and you must write programs in the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/). Thus, if you do not have an IDE installed on your laptop, please install either Visual Studio Code or Atom. If you do not have Python installed on your laptop, please install Python 3 using the [installation guide for your operating system](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/#python-3-installation-guides). Finally, you need to install `gatorgrade` by following the next two steps:
  - First, [install `pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/)
  - Then, install `gatorgrade` with `pipx install gatorgrade`

### Fixing a Bug

The sorting program, `sort.py`, should take in a list of numbers as arguments and print the numbers in ascending order. 
```console
$ python sort.py 23 4 15 8 16 42
[0] 4
[1] 8
[2] 15
[3] 16
[4] 23
[5] 42
```

However, when you run `sort.py`, you will notice that it does not produce the expected output. In fact, you will see an error.

```console
NameError: name 'sys' is not defined
```

Please fix this bug in `sort.py` by importing the `sys` module. Then, in your IDE, open the version control feature--in Visual Studio Code this will be the [Source Control tab](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_git-support) in the left sidebar and in Atom this will be the [Git panel](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/github-package/#github-package) that can be toggled in the Status Bar in the lower-right corner. You should see `sort.py` in the list of unstaged changes (just "Changes" in Visual Studio Code).

Click on `sort.py` in the list of unstaged changes. This will open the changes, or "diffs", that you have made to the file. Since you have made only one change to `sort.py`, you can stage the entire file. To do this in Visual Studio Code, hover over `sort.py` in the list of unstaged changes and click the + icon. To do this in Atom, you can either double-click `sort.py` in the list of unstaged changes or single-click `sort.py` and press `Enter`. This will move `sort.py` into the list of staged changes. For those familiar with using the `git` command-line utility, this action is equivalent to running `git add sort.py`.

Next, in the commit message box, type "Import missing sys module" or something similar. This will be the first line of the commit message, which is also referred to as its subject line. Most of the time, just a subject line will suffice. However, there may be cases where you want to attach more detail to a commit. You can do so in the body of the commit message, which is separated from the subject line by one empty line.

Notice that this commit message, "Import missing sys module", abides by [the seven rules of a great Git commit message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/). Specifically, it is less than 50 characters long, it is capitalized, it does not end with a period, and it uses the [imperative mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood). Notice also that it describes not only *what* change was made, but also *why*.

Contrast it to the following alternative, but inferior commit messages.

1. "Updates". This commit message does not describe the change in the commit.
1. "Importing missing sys module.". The subject line of this commit message contains 4 characters--"ing" and "."--that add nothing to its meaning. While 4 characters may not seem like many, if the subject line is 50 characters long (i.e. the longest recommended length), these useless characters make up nearly 10% of the subject line.
1. "Import sys module". This commit message lacks detail about why the change was made.

Once you have finished typing the commit message, you can create the commit. In Visual Studio Code, you can do this by clicking the checkmark right above the commit message box. In Atom, you can create the commit by clicking the button directly below the commit message box. For those familiar with using the `git` command-line utility, this action is equivalent to running `git commit -m "Import missing sys module"`.

### Fixing Additional Bugs

When you run `sort.py` again, you will notice that it still does not produce the expected output. Please track down and fix an additional bug in `sort.py`. You may need to refer to the Python documentation on [`sys.argv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html?highlight=argv#sys.argv) and the [`enumerate`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=enumerate#enumerate) built-in function. As you are fixing bugs, do not yet perform any Git actions in your IDE.

Once you have completed one bug fix, open the version control feature in your IDE and click on `sort.py` in the list of unstaged changes to see the diff. You should see that `sort.py` contains one hunk, or one group of differing lines. You should commit one change (hunk) at a time to keep each commit small and focused. If you find additional bugs, you may be tempted to stage the entire file and create a commit with the message "Fix bugs". However, if you want to revert one of these bug fixes in the future, creating a "Fix bugs" commit would first make it difficult to locate the commit with the bug fix you want to revert and then impossible to `git revert` the one bug fix without reverting the other.

In both IDEs, you can select a hunk by highlighting it. In Visual Studio Code, you can stage the selected hunk by right-clicking, then clicking the "Stage Selected Ranges" item in the menu that appears. In Atom, you can stage the selected hunk by clicking the "Stage Selection" button.

For each hunk, please write a commit message that abides by [the seven rules of a great Git commit message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) and that describes the change and why it was made. Then, create a commit. You should have created at least one commit in this step.

### Adding a Feature

In addition to sorting in ascending order, `sort.py` should be able to sort numbers in descending order. The user should be able to indicate whether the order should be descending by passing in the word `desc` as a command-line argument to `sort.py`.

```console
$ python sort.py desc 23 4 15 8 16 42
[0] 42
[1] 23
[2] 16
[3] 15
[4] 8
[5] 4
```

Please implement this feature and commit it using best commit practices.

### Reflection

Answer all questions in `writing/reflection.md`. As you do, commit your changes using best commit practices. Instead of creating a commit at the end with the message, "Answer reflection questions", you should commit after answering each question and describe your changes in the commit messages. For instance, after you answer the first question, you might create a commit with the message, "Reflect on past commit practices".

## GatorGrade

You can check the baseline writing and commit requirements of this project by running department's assignment checking `gatorgrade` tool To use `gatorgrade`, you first need to make sure you have Python installed. If not, please see:

- [Setting Up Python on Windows](https://realpython.com/lessons/python-windows-setup/)
- [Python 3 Installation and Setup Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
- [How to Install Python 3 and Set Up a Local Programming Environment on Windows 10](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-windows-10)

Then, you need to install `gatorgrade`:

- First, [install `pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/)
- Then, install `gatorgrade` with `pipx install gatorgrade`

Finally, you can run `gatorgrade`:

`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`

## Receiving Assistance

If you are having trouble completing any part of this project, then please talk
with either the course instructor or a student technical leader during the practical
session. Alternatively, you may ask questions in the Discord channel for this
course. Finally, you can schedule a meeting during the course instructor's
office hours.

## Practical Assessment

The grade that a student receives on this practical assignment is a checkmark grade (0 or 1) and is based on:

- **GitHub Actions CI Build Status**: Students are encouraged to
  repeatedly try to complete the assignment until it passes all of GatorGrader's
  checks. Since additional checks on the source code and/or
  technical writing may be encoded in GitHub Actions CI's actions and, moreover, all of
  the GatorGrader checks are also run in GitHub Actions CI, students will receive a
  checkmark grade if their last before-the-deadline build passes and a green
  &#x2714; appears in their GitHub commit log instead of a red &#x2717;. 

Students will receive 1 if their solution passes all GatorGrader checks and receives a green  &#x2714;  in their last commit. 

All grades for this project will be reported through a student's GitHub gradebook repository (we will set this up soon).
